# satsmacs
This is my personal Emacs configuration. 

## Inspiration
A ton of inspiration (and code) comes from here - https://github.com/BrunoBonacci/lambdamacs and the Emacs from scratch series on YouTube.


## current status
- This is a WIP.
- I'm not building this as a "product", atleast at this point. You are
  most welcome to fork and make this your own or use my config as-is.
